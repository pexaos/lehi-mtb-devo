        <h3>  Who are we?</h3>
                The Lehi Junior Devo Mountain Bike Team is a team of 7th and 8th graders who live within the boundaries of Willowcreek Middle School.
                
                <h3> Who can join the team?</h3>
                Anyone with a bike!!! Our team consists of boys and girls with varying degrees of experience. There are no tryouts and we accept anyone who can ride a bike and wants to learn the life-long activity of mountain biking.
                
                <h3>  Is there a team for high school riders?</h3>
                Yes! The Lehi High School Mountain Bike Team is for students between 9th and 12th grade that live in the boundaries of Lehi High School. Their website can be found at lehimtb.com.
                
                <h3> Do the riders have to be experienced mountain bikers?</h3>
                No!! One of the wonderful things about the Utah Mountain Bike League is that everyone can be part of the team. As part of the Junior Development program we focus on giving riders the skills they need to be successful on the trails.

    <h1>What is the season like?</h1>
    <p>  We run 3 practices a week in order to give a variety of options based on the riders. Riders are expected to attend at least 2 rides a week. Mondays are race-ready practices and will consist of riding loop courses and trying as much as possible to simulate the race environment.  Thursdays are skills days!! If there is a practice to make, this is the one. Thursdays will consist of learning and practicing bike handling skills. Even the most experienced rider still needs to work on their skills. Saturday morning rides are our fun rides.

                <h1>Does my child need their own bike?</h1>
                    <p>  Yes! Each rider needs their own bike and helmet. Riders need to have a good quality bike ("not a Walmart type bike") that can last through the season. We put a lot of miles and wear and tear on these bikes and each rider needs to have a bike that can be functional and still safe. Cheaper, less durable bikes can easily become a safety hazard, there is no reason to go out and spend thousands of dollars on a bike. If you have questions on which kind of bike to buy, please contact a coach or your local bike shop.</P>
